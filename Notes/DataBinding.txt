Data Binding:
----------------------------------
It refers to the communication component file(.ts) and template file(.html) within
a component.

There are two kinds of data Binding
1.one way data Binding:= 
Using this we can send data from template to component or component to template.

There are three posible way for one way data Binding:
a.string interpolation:
It is used to get the data from component file to template file as a string.
It is represented with double braces.
ex. //html                                   //ts

<p>The fruit is {{name}}<p>               public class componentname{
                                                name:string="apple"
                                            }

but it always pass data as string,sometimes we ness to pass other data such as boolean. for taht we can use 
property Binding.

B.property Binding:
It is also used to get the data from component file to template file as it is.
It is represented as square braces.
      
<element [property]="variable" >
ex.    //html                                      //ts
<     img[src]="url" [alt]="title"/>            public class componentname{
                                                        url="path"
                                                        title="sinchan"
                                                    }

C.Event Binding:
It is used to send data from templateto component file as an event. Paranthesis().

    <element>(event)="funcationName()">                                     
           //html                                       //ts
    <button(click)="fun()">click</button>          public class componentname{
                                                        fun(){
                                                            alert("helloo")
                                                        }
                                                    }
                                                        


2.Two way data Binding:


command:
#ng new component
ng serve
