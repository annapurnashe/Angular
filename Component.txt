-Components are the basic building block of angular application.
Whole application is divided into logical small UI parts called Components.

Each components have four files such as
   html(template) -----used for view. 
   css(style)------used for styling.
   ts(component)----used for logic.
   spec.ts(specifiaction)----used for testing.
